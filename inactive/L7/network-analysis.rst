Network analysis in Python
==========================

Finding a shortest path using a specific street network is a common GIS problem that has many practical
applications. For example navigators are one of those "every-day" applications where **routing** using specific algorithms is used
to find the optimal route between two (or multiple) points.

It is also possible to perform network analysis such as tranposrtation routing in Python.
`Networkx <https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/>`__ is a Python module that provides
a lot tools that can be used to analyze networks on various different ways. It also contains algorithms
such as `Dijkstras algorithm <https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/reference/generated/networkx.algorithms.shortest_paths.weighted.single_source_dijkstra.html#networkx.algorithms.shortest_paths.weighted.single_source_dijkstra>`__ or
`A* <https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/reference/generated/networkx.algorithms.shortest_paths.astar.astar_path.html#networkx.algorithms.shortest_paths.astar.astar_path>`__ algoritm that are commonly used to find shortest paths along transportation network.

To be able to conduct network analysis, it is, of course, necessary to have a network that is used for the analyses.
`Osmnx <https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx>`__ package that we just explored in previous tutorial, makes it really easy to
retrieve routable networks from OpenStreetMap with different transport modes (walking, cycling and driving). Osmnx also
combines some functionalities from ``networkx`` module to make it straightforward to conduct routing along OpenStreetMap data.

Next we will test the routing functionalities of osmnx by finding a shortest path between two points based on drivable roads.

Let's first download the OSM data from Kamppi but this time include only such street segments that are walkable.
In omsnx it is possible to retrieve only such streets that are drivable by specifying ``'drive'`` into ``network_type`` parameter that can be used to
specify what kind of streets are retrieved from OpenStreetMap (other possibilities are ``walk`` and ``bike``).

.. ipython:: python

    import osmnx as ox
    import networkx as nx
    import geopandas as gpd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import pandas as pd

    place_name = "Kamppi, Helsinki, Finland"
    graph = ox.graph_from_place(place_name, network_type='drive')
    @savefig street_network.png width=7in
    fig, ax = ox.plot_graph(graph)

Okey so now we have retrieved only such streets where it is possible to drive with a car. Let's confirm
this by taking a look at the attributes of the street network. Easiest way to do this is to convert the
graph (nodes and edges) into GeoDataFrames.

.. ipython:: python

    edges = ox.graph_to_gdfs(graph, nodes=False, edges=True)

- Let's check what columns do we have in our data

.. ipython:: python

    edges.columns

Okey, so we have quite many columns in our GeoDataFrame. Most of the columns are fairly self-explanatory but the following table describes all of them.

+----------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+------------------------+
| Column                                                         | Description                            | Data type              |
+================================================================+========================================+========================+
| `bridge <http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:bridge>`__     | Bridge feature                         | boolean                |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+------------------------+
| geometry                                                       | Geometry of the feature                | Shapely.geometry       |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+------------------------+
| `highway <http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:highway>`__   | Tag for roads, paths (road type)       | str (list if multiple) |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+------------------------+
| `lanes <http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:lanes>`__       | Number of lanes                        | int (or nan)           |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+------------------------+
| `lenght <http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:length>`__     | The length of a feature in meters      | float                  |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+------------------------+
| `maxspeed <http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:maxspeed>`__ | maximum legal speed limit              | int (list if multiple) |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+------------------------+
| `name <http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:name>`__         | Name of the (street) element           | str (or nan)           |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+------------------------+
| `oneway <http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:oneway>`__     | Street is usable only in one direction | boolean                |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+------------------------+
| `osmid <http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Node>`__            | Unique node ids of the element         | list                   |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+------------------------+
| `u <http://ow.ly/bV8n30h7Ufm>`__                               | The first node of networkx edge tuple  | int                    |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+------------------------+
| `v <http://ow.ly/bV8n30h7Ufm>`__                               | The last node of networkx edge tuple   | int                    |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+------------------------+

Most of the attributes comes directly from the OpenStreetMap, however, columns ``u`` and ``v`` are networkx specific ids.

- Let's take a look what kind of features we have in ``highway`` column.

.. ipython:: python

    edges['highway'].value_counts()
    print("Coordinate system:", edges.crs)

Okey, now we can confirm that as a result our street network indeed only contains such streets where it is allowed to drive with a car as there are no e.g. cycleways of footways included in the data.
We can also see that the CRS of the GeoDataFrame seems to be WGS84 (i.e. epsg: 4326).

Let's continue and find the shortest path between two points based on the distance. As the data is in WGS84 format, we might first want to reproject our data into metric system so that our map looks better.
Luckily there is a handy function in osmnx called ``project_graph()`` to project the graph data in UTM format.

.. ipython:: python

    graph_proj = ox.project_graph(graph)
    fig, ax = ox.plot_graph(graph_proj)
    @savefig proj_graph.png width=5in
    plt.tight_layout()

- Let's see how our data looks like now.

.. ipython:: python

    nodes_proj, edges_proj = ox.graph_to_gdfs(graph_proj, nodes=True, edges=True)
    print("Coordinate system:", edges_proj.crs)
    edges_proj.head()

Okey, as we can see from the CRS the data is now in `UTM projection <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system>`__ using zone 35 which is the one used for Finland,
and indeed the orientation of the map and the geometry values also confirm this.

Analyzing the network properties
--------------------------------

Now as we have seen some of the basic functionalities of osmnx such as downloading the data and converting data from graph to GeoDataFrame,
we can take a look some of the analytical features of omsnx. Osmnx includes many useful functionalities to
extract information about the network.

- To calculate some of the basic street network measures we can use ``basic_stats()`` function of osmnx

.. ipython:: python

    stats = ox.basic_stats(graph_proj)
    stats

To be able to extract the more advanced statistics (and some of the missing ones above) from the street network, it is required to have information
about the coverage area of the network. Let's calculate the area of the `convex hull <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull>`__ of the street network and see what we can get.
As certain statistics are produced separately for each node, they produce a lot of output. Let's merge both stats and put them into Pandas Series to keep things mroe compact.

.. ipython:: python

    area = edges_proj.unary_union.convex_hull.area
    stats = ox.basic_stats(graph_proj, area=area)
    extended_stats = ox.extended_stats(graph_proj, ecc=True, bc=True, cc=True)
    for key, value in extended_stats.items():
        stats[key] = value
    pd.Series(stats)

Okey, now we have a **LOT** of information about our street network that can be used to understand its structure.
We can for example see that the average node density in our network is ``153 nodes/km`` and that the total edge length of our network is ``19787.7 meters``.
Furthermore, we can see that the `degree centrality <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality>`__ of our network is
on average ``0.0334533``. Degree is a simple centrality measure that counts how many neighbors a node has (here a fraction of nodes it is connected to).
Another interesting measure is the `PageRank <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank>`__ that measures the importance of specific node
in the graph. Here we can see that the most important node in our graph seem to a node with osmid ``25416262``.
PageRank was the algorithm that Google first developed (Larry Page & Sergei Brin) to order the search engine results and became famous for.

You can read the `Wikipedia article about different centrality measures <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality>`__ if you are interested what the other centrality measures mean.

.. hint::

    There are a lot of good examples of different ways to analyze the network properties with osmnx.
    Take a look at the `Osmnx examples repository <https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx-examples>`__.



Shortest path analysis
----------------------

Let's now calculate the shortest path between two points. First we need to specify the source and target locations
for our route. Let's use the centroid of our network as the source location and the furthest point in East in our network as the target location.

Let's first determine the centroid of our network. We can take advantage of the ``bounds`` attribute to find out the bounding boxes for each feature in our data. We then make a unary union of those features and make a bounding box geometry out of those values that enables us to determine the centroid of our data.

- This is what the bounds command gives us.

.. ipython:: python

    edges_proj.bounds.head()

Okey so it is a DataFrame of minimum and maximum x- and y coordinates.

- Let's create a bounding box out of those.

.. ipython:: python

    from shapely.geometry import box
    bbox = box(*edges_proj.unary_union.bounds)
    print(bbox)

Okey so as a result we seem to have a Polygon, but what actually happened here? First of all, we took the Geometries from our ``edges_proj`` GeoDataFrame (123 features) and made a unary union of those features (as a result we have a MultiLineString).
From the MultiLineString we can retrieve the maximum and minimum x and y coordinates of the geometry using the ``bounds`` attribute.
The bounds command returns a tuple of four coordinates (minx, miny, maxx, maxy). As a final step we feed those coordinates into box() function that creates a shapely.Polygon object out of those coordinates.
The * -character is used to unpack the values from the tuple (`see details <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#unpacking-argument-lists>`__)

- Now we can extract the centroid of our bounding box as the source location.

.. ipython:: python

    orig_point = bbox.centroid
    print(orig_point)

- Let's now find the easternmost node in our street network. We can do this by calculating the x coordinates and finding out which node has the largest x-coordinate value. Let's ensure that the values are floats.

.. ipython:: python

    nodes_proj['x'] = nodes_proj.x.astype(float)
    maxx = nodes_proj['x'].max()

- Let's retrieve the target Point having the largest x-coordinate. We can do this by using the .loc function of Pandas that we have used already many times in earlier tutorials.

.. ipython:: python

    target_loc = nodes_proj.loc[nodes_proj['x']==maxx, :]
    print(target_loc)

Okey now we can see that as a result we have a GeoDataFrame with only one node and the information associated with it.

- Let's extract the Point geometry from the data.

.. ipython:: python

    target_point = target_loc.geometry.values[0]
    print(target_point)

- Let's now find the nearest graph nodes (and their node-ids) to these points. For osmnx we need to parse the coordinates of the Point as coordinate-tuple with Latitude, Longitude coordinates.
As our data is now projected to UTM projection, we need to specify with ``method`` parameter that the function uses
'euclidean' distances to calculate the distance from the point to the closest node.
This becomes important if you want to know the actual distance between the Point and the closest node which you can retrieve by specifying parameter ``return_dist=True``.

.. ipython:: python

    orig_xy = (orig_point.y, orig_point.x)
    target_xy = (target_point.y, target_point.x)
    orig_node = ox.get_nearest_node(graph_proj, orig_xy, method='euclidean')
    target_node = ox.get_nearest_node(graph_proj, target_xy, method='euclidean')
    o_closest = nodes_proj.loc[orig_node]
    t_closest = nodes_proj.loc[target_node]
    print(orig_node)
    print(target_node)

- Let's make a GeoDataFrame out of these series

.. ipython:: python

    od_nodes = gpd.GeoDataFrame([o_closest, t_closest], geometry='geometry', crs=nodes_proj.crs)

Okey, as a result we got now the closest node-ids of our origin and target locations.

- Now we are ready to do the routing and find the shortest path between the origin and target locations
by using the ``shortest_path()`` `function <https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/reference/generated/networkx.algorithms.shortest_paths.generic.shortest_path.html>`__ of networkx.
With ``weight`` -parameter we can specify that ``'length'`` attribute should be used as the cost impedance in the routing.

.. ipython:: python

    route = nx.shortest_path(G=graph_proj, source=orig_node, target=target_node, weight='length')
    print(route)

Okey, as a result we get a list of all the nodes that are along the shortest path. We could extract the locations of those nodes from the ``nodes_proj`` GeoDataFrame and create a LineString presentation of the points,
but luckily, osmnx can do that for us and we can plot shortest path by using ``plot_graph_route()`` function.

.. ipython:: python

    fig, ax = ox.plot_graph_route(graph_proj, route, origin_point=orig_xy, destination_point=target_xy)
    @savefig routing.png width=5in
    plt.tight_layout()

Awesome! Now we have a the shortest path between our origin and target locations.
Being able to analyze shortest paths between locations can be valuable information for many applications.
Here, we only analyzed the shortest paths based on distance but quite often it is more useful to find the
optimal routes between locations based on the travelled time. Here, for example we could calculate the time that it takes
to cross each road segment by dividing the length of the road segment with the speed limit and calculate the optimal routes by
taking into account the speed limits as well that might alter the result especially on longer trips than here.

Saving shortest paths to disk
-----------------------------

Quite often you need to save the route e.g. as a Shapefile.
Hence, let's continue still a bit and see how we can make a Shapefile of our route with some information associated with it.

- First we need to get the nodes that belong to the shortest path.

.. ipython:: python

    route_nodes = nodes_proj.loc[route]
    print(route_nodes)


- Now we can create a LineString out of the Point geometries of the nodes

.. ipython:: python

    from shapely.geometry import LineString, Point
    route_line = LineString(list(route_nodes.geometry.values))
    print(route_line)

- Let's make a GeoDataFrame having some useful information about our route such as a list of the osmids that are part of the route and the length of the route.

.. ipython:: python

    route_geom = gpd.GeoDataFrame(crs=edges_proj.crs)
    route_geom['geometry'] = None
    route_geom['osmids'] = None

- Let's add the information: geometry, a list of osmids and the length of the route.

.. ipython:: python

    route_geom.loc[0, 'geometry'] = route_line
    route_geom.loc[0, 'osmids'] = str(list(route_nodes['osmid'].values))
    route_geom['length_m'] = route_geom.length

Now we have a GeoDataFrame that we can save to disk. Let's still confirm that everything is okey by plotting our route
on top of our street network, and plot also the origin and target points on top of our map.

- Let's first prepare a GeoDataFrame for our origin and target points.

.. ipython:: python

    od_points = gpd.GeoDataFrame(crs=edges_proj.crs)
    od_points['geometry'] = None
    od_points['type'] = None
    od_points.loc[0, ['geometry', 'type']] = orig_point, 'Origin'
    od_points.loc[1, ['geometry', 'type']] = target_point, 'Target'
    od_points.head()

- Let's also get the buildings for our area and plot them as well.

.. ipython:: python

    buildings = ox.buildings_from_place(place_name)
    buildings_proj = buildings.to_crs(crs=edges_proj.crs)

- Let's now plot the route and the street network elements to verify that everything is as it should.

.. ipython:: python

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    edges_proj.plot(ax=ax, linewidth=0.75, color='gray')
    nodes_proj.plot(ax=ax, markersize=2, color='gray')
    buildings_proj.plot(ax=ax, facecolor='khaki', alpha=0.7)
    route_geom.plot(ax=ax, linewidth=4, linestyle='--', color='red')
    od_points.plot(ax=ax, markersize=24, color='green')
    @savefig routing_with_buildings.png width=6in
    plt.tight_layout()

Great everything seems to be in order! As you can see, now we have a full
control of all the elements of our map and we can use all the aesthetic
properties that matplotlib provides to modify how our map will look like.
Now we can save to disk all the elements that we want.

.. ipython:: python

    # Parse the place name for the output file names (replace spaces with underscores and remove commas)
    place_name_out = place_name.replace(' ', '_').replace(',','')
    streets_out = r"/home/geo/%s_streets.shp" % place_name_out
    route_out = r"/home/geo/Route_from_a_to_b_at_%s.shp" % place_name_out
    nodes_out = r"/home/geo/%s_nodes.shp" % place_name_out
    buildings_out = r"/home/geo/%s_buildings.shp" % place_name_out
    od_out = r"/home/geo/%s_route_OD_points.shp" % place_name_out

.. ipython:: python
    :suppress:

        place_name_out = place_name.replace(' ', '_').replace(',','')
        streets_out = os.path.join(os.path.abspath('data'), "%s_streets.shp" % place_name_out)
        route_out = os.path.join(os.path.abspath('data'), "Route_from_a_to_b_at_%s.shp" % place_name_out)
        nodes_out = os.path.join(os.path.abspath('data'), "%s_nodes.shp" % place_name_out)
        buildings_out = os.path.join(os.path.abspath('data'), "%s_buildings.shp" % place_name_out)
        od_out = os.path.join(os.path.abspath('data'), "%s_route_OD_points.shp" % place_name_out)

As there are certain columns with such data values that Shapefile format does not support (such as ``list`` or ``boolean``), we need to convert those into strings to be able to export the data to Shapefile.

- Columns with invalid values

.. ipython:: python

    invalid_cols = ['lanes', 'maxspeed', 'name', 'oneway', 'osmid']

- Iterate over invalid columns and convert them to string format

.. ipython:: python

    for col in invalid_cols:
        edges_proj[col] = edges_proj[col].astype(str)

- Save the data

.. ipython:: python

    edges_proj.to_file(streets_out)
    route_geom.to_file(route_out)
    nodes_proj.to_file(nodes_out)
    od_points.to_file(od_out)
    buildings[['geometry', 'name', 'addr:street']].to_file(buildings_out)

Great now we have saved all the data that was used to produce the maps as Shapefiles.
