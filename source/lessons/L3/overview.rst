Overview
========

During this week we will learn a few really useful and commonly used GIS functionalities using Geopandas, namely:

1. :doc:`Geocoding addresses to Points (and vice versa) <geocoding>`
2. :doc:`Conducting Point in Polygon queries <point-in-polygon>`
3. :doc:`Making Spatial joins <spatial-join>`
4. :doc:`Finding Nearest neighbour of a geometry <nearest-neighbour>`

Learning goals
--------------

After this weeks' lesson you should be able to:

 - Do geocoding, i.e. converting addresses into Points (and vice versa)
 - Conduct a Point in Polygon queries
 - Read data from KML file
 - Make spatial and table joins between layers
 - Find the nearest neighbour from Point -objects.
