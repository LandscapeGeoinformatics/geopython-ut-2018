Overview
========

During this week we will learn a few really useful and commonly used GIS functionalities using Geopandas, namely:

1. :doc:`Data classification <reclassify>`
2. :doc:`Geometric operations: Overlay analysis, spatial aggregation <geometric-operations>`
3. :doc:`Exercise 4 <ex-4>`
4. :doc:`Exercise 4 hints <exercise-4-hints>`

Learning goals
--------------

After this week's lesson you should be able to:

 - Reclassify data based on different criteria (custom or common classifiers).

 - Do a simple overlay analysis such as selecting data from one layer based on boundaries of another layer.

 - Aggregate data, i.e. merge geometric objects together, based on some common identifier.

 - Simplify geometries
