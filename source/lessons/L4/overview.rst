Lesson 4 overview
=================

During this lesson we will learn a few really useful and commonly used GIS functionalities using Geopandas, namely:

1. :doc:`Data classification <reclassify>`
2. :doc:`Heatmaps with Google Maps <gmaps-heatmap>`
3. :doc:`Exercise 4 <ex-4>`
4. :doc:`Exercise 4 hints <exercise-4-hints>`

Learning goals

 - merge data, i.e. join spatial and non-spatial datasets together, based on some common identifier.
