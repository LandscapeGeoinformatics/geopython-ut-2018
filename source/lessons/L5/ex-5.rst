Exercise 5
==========

This lesson we will practice how to create static and interactive maps in Python.

- Don't forget to check out the `hints for this lesson's exercise <exercise-5-hints.html>`_.

- Scores on this exercise are out of **10 points**.

Read a few useful additional hints about what to consider when creating maps `from this post <https://www.gislounge.com/ten-things-to-consider-when-making-a-map>`_.

Consider looking for some interesting `datasets from Kaggle <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets>`_,
the `Estonian Geoportal <https://geoportaal.maaamet.ee/>`_ or `Estonian Open Data Portal <https://opendata.riik.ee/>`_

Problem 1: Visualize a static map with multiple layers on it (5 points)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Play around with the data that was used during the lesson (or find interesting other datasets and mix them in) and **create an interesting, good and beautiful STATIC map**.

Consider the design - classifications, colors and colormaps, resolution, legend) ...
and the story - which datasets/layers together make an interesting map to present.

**Use your imagination**, you can e.g. do some additional or different calculations on the datasets we used in the course
or apply the analyses we have done earlier in the course to new datasets that you found online (or from your other wor/study projects).

But notice that the main aim here is that you try to do the visualizations as best as you can, it needs to look good and should make sense.

Submit your maps (png) and source code (.py or .ipynb)` to Moodle.


Problem 2: Visualize an interactive map (5 points)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Play around with the data that was provided for you and used during the lessons and **create as interesting, good and beautiful INTERACTIVE map**.
Use **either** Bokeh **or** Folium.

Same as with the static map challenge above, **use your imagination**. You can e.g. do some additional or different calculations on the datasets we used in the course
or apply the analyses we have done earlier in the course to new datasets that you found online (or from your other wor/study projects).

But notice that the main aim here is that you try to do the visualizations as best as you can, it needs to look good and should make sense.

Submit your maps (png) and source code (.py or .ipynb)` to Moodle.
